# Patient-Monitoring-System
This system continuously collects health-related data from patients using wearable sensors, processes the data in real-time, and analyzes it for anomalies (such as irregular heartbeats or rising blood pressure). The system would then generate alerts for healthcare providers or patients, enabling rapid intervention.
